          Welcome to SMA Connect, where you can find out all the donation campaigns presented on a safe platform. 
          You can choose any of the campaigns you are interested in and donate easily. 
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the donation campaigns have certificated account numbers and approvements by doctors. 
          You can also check out the ‘patient details pages’ which contains information about the patient.

          You can sign up as a donator, doctor or patient. Your user-type information will be saved to your e-mail address.
         Next time when you log in, the system will be opened up with your choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the medicine and surgery prices are too expensive, donations are taking up an important space for the treatment. 
          Our mission is so clear: to connect volunteers with opportunities to make a meaningful impact.
